Welcome to Vestige! You find yourself as a ghost in the lobby of somewhere not-quite-the-afterlife staring face-to-face
with a ghost receptionist behind the front desk. With no knowledge of your human life, you learn that you must traverse 
through memories of the past to piece together the moments leading up to your death. Some ghosts you encounter will not 
take too kindly to fresh meat, with some more than others. They appear to hold some sort of grudge? However, it is 
rather interesting how natural of a fighter you are, as you seem to be able to handle weapons fairly well…
